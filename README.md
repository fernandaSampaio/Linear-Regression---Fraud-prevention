# Linear-Regression
Logistic Regression is a statistical method used to predict the probability of a binary dependent variable (i.e., with two possible outcomes, such as yes/no, 0/1, true/false) and one or more independent variables. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts probabilities that can be transformed into one of the two possible categories.
