# Linear-Regression---Fraud-prevention
 Linear regression is a model used to predict a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. In fraud prevention, it helps identify patterns in financial transactions to understand "normal" behavior. This way, it can detect transactions that differ from the expected pattern and might be fraudulent.
